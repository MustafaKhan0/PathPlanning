      "1. **Understand the Initial Setup**: The grid is 10x10x10. We have defined obstacle coordinates that the agents need to avoid while navigating from their initial positions to their goals. The agents are Alice, Bob, Chad, and Dave, each with a distinct starting and ending position.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Ensure No Collisions with Obstacles and Other Agents**: The paths should be carefully planned to avoid any collisions with the obstacles or each other. Each move can only go in one of the x, y, or z directions per step.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Plan Paths Individually**:\n",
      "   - Alice: Move in the z-axis from 6 to 3, avoiding overlay with other agent plans.\n",
      "   - Bob: Move along x, y, and then z to reach the goal, respect obstacle and other agent paths conditions.\n",
      "   - Chad: Move along the x-axis directly to the goal, explicitly straight as no other agent interferes in (x,y) at any segmented steps.\n",
      "   - Dave: Move along different axes respecting obstacle positions and plans from other agents.\n",

      "1. **Alice's Path**: Her path collided with the obstacle at (7, 8, 8). Thus, an alternate path should avoid this point and any other potential collisions.\n",
      "2. **Bob's Path**: His path collided at the (9, 5, 6) with an obstacle. Altering the path to avoid this collision.\n",

      "   - Furthermore, the end goal also collided at (1, 1, 3).\n",
      "   - We need to reroute around these points using a collision-free approach.\n",
